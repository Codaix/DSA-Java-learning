//collection framework: 
// list set and map.
// 1. List: It is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate elements.
//    It is implemented by ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.
//    ArrayList and Vectors are replica of arrays and LinkedList is replica of doubly Linked List.
//    why do we need arraylist and vector when we got array?
//    solution: because of synchronization issue.
//    synchronization issue: array list are not synchronized, which means that they are not thread-safe.
//    Vector is synchronized, which means that it is thread-safe. which in leyman means we can use vector when more than one people are using it at same time.
