//collection framework: 
// collection interfaces: Collection, List, Set, Map
// list set and map.
// 1. List: It is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate elements.
//    It is implemented by ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.
//    ArrayList and Vectors are replica of arrays and LinkedList is replica of doubly Linked List.
//    They both are dynamic in nature, which means that they can grow and shrink in size as per the requirement.    
//    why do we need arraylist and vector when we got array?
//    solution: because of synchronization issue.
//    synchronization issue: Vector are not synchronized, which means that they are not thread-safe.
//    ArrayList is synchronized, which means that it is thread-safe. which in leyman means we can use vector when more than one people are using it at same time.
