package DAY16;
// we have linear and binary searching techniques.
// linear search technique checks for each element and return true and false based on the 
// condition we have.

// Binary Search: it will only work with sorted elements.
// e.g.arr[] and we need to get if t is in the array or not. 
// 1. we need to get the mid of the array.
// 2. we need to check the condition whether the mid is equal to the target or not
// 3. if unequal, we need to check if the target is smaller or greater than the mid element.
// 4. if mid element is greater than the target, there is no need to search the elements to the left of the mid element.
// 5. if mid element is samller, no need to check at the right hand side of the mid element.
// 6. now, for each case, we need to repeat the step 1 till we hit the target.
